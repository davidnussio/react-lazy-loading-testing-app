# Lazy loading

This is a simple example of how to use lazy loading in a React application.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pnpm install`
3. Run `pnpm start`
4. Open page in your browser
5. Navigate to a the `Lazy` page
6. Kill the server
7. Run `pnpm start` again
8. Navigate to the `Lazy` page again without refreshing the page

Now you should see the lazy loaded component could not be loaded because the chunk hashes are different.
